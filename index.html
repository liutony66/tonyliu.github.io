I am a Bioengineering PhD student at Stanford, interested in developing better treatments for severe psychiatric conditions, such as major depression and addiction. I think <i>part</i> of the solution lies in better understanding how the brain and body give rise to these conditions, and targeting these proximal causes. To this end, I'm interested in systems neuroscience and <b>reverse-translation</b> across species, <b>computational psychiatry</b>, and spatially and temporally targeted treatment approaches (such as <b>neural interfaces</b>).

I'm grateful to be funded by the <a href="https://knight-hennessy.stanford.edu/">Knight-Hennessy Fellowship</a>. I previously received a BS in Physics at Yale, and have worked on systems neuroscience in <a href="https://jeannelab.org">small brains</a> and <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04004169">closed-loop neuromodulation</a> for treatment-resistant depression.

<li>ü¶ü Dec 2021. Our work on predicting neural circuit functional properties (like connection strength) from connectomics has come out in <a href="https://authors.elsevier.com/c/1eFUV3QW8Rwqra">Current Biology</a>. Please reach out with any questions and feedback! Lucky to have learned from Dr. Jamie Jeanne, Pasha Davoudian, and Dr. Kristyn Lizbinski at Yale :)</li>
<li>‚ö° Oct 2021. The first report of closed-loop deep brain stimulation for a patient with treatment-resistant depression has come out in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01480-w">Nature Medicine</a>. See coverage of the clinical trial in <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/04/health/depression-implant-treatment-wellness/index.html">CNN</a> and the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/04/health/depression-treatment-deep-brain-stimulation.html">New York Times</a>. So grateful to have worked with the big team including Drs. Katherine Scangos, Andrew Krystal, Eddie Chang, and Ankit Khambhati at UCSF.</li>

<li>I'm also really interested in critical psychiatry and the limitations of biological psychiatry and over-medicalizing human wellness. Better understanding the brain and building better treatments may offer part of the solution to helping people with psychiatric conditions, but it's just as urgent to address the social determinants of these conditions -- like inequality, trauma, and racism. Please reach out if you ever want to chat about this, I'm always trying to learn more!</li>
